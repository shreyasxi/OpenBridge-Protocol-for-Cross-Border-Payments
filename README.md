**A Hybrid Blockchain Protocol for Scalable, Compliant Cross-Border Payments**

This repository hosts the full academic report for *OpenBridge*, a blockchain-based architecture designed to streamline cross-border payment systems using hybrid Layer-1/Layer-2 infrastructure, zk-STARK privacy, and oracle-driven FX settlement.

The project was developed as part of the postgraduate module **IB9YW0 â€“ Fintech: Digital Currencies and Decentralised Finance** at **Warwick Business School**. It received the highest mark in the cohort and was recognized for its originality, technical depth, and clarity of design.

## ðŸ“˜ Abstract
Despite the rapid globalization of commerce and finance, cross-border payments continue to rely on legacy infrastructure that is slow, expensive, and opaque. OpenBridge proposes a resilient, compliance-ready framework that integrates:
- Layer-1 PoA consensus for regulatory alignment,
- Layer-2 rollups for scalable throughput,
- zk-STARK circuits for private compliance, and
- programmable FX execution using multi-currency smart contracts.
